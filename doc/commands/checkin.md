## Summary

This function squashes differences between the last TFS commit and HEAD into one TFS-checkin and mark it as descendant of both previous TFS-checkin and HEAD.

It works similarly to [checkintool](checkintool.md), except checkintool launches the standard TFS checkin window.

The `checkin` command differs from [rcheckin](rcheckin.md) in that the latter mirrors a series of commits into TFS instead of squashing them into one.

## Synopsis

    Usage: git-tfs checkin [options] [ref-to-checkin]
    where options are:
        -d, --debug
            Show debug output about everything git-tfs does

        -i, --tfs-remote, --remote, --id=VALUE
            The remote ID of the TFS to interact with

        -m, --comment=VALUE
            A comment for the changeset

        --no-build-default-comment
            Do not concatenate commit comments for the changeset comment.

        --no-merge
            Omits setting commit being checked in as parent, thus allowing to rebase remaining onto TFS changeset without exceeding merge commits.

        -f, --force=VALUE
            The policy override reason.

        -w, --work-item=VALUE1:VALUE2
            Associated work items:
                e.g. -w12345 to associate with 12345
                or -w12345:resolve to resolve 12345

        --no-gate
            Disables gated checkin.
        
        --workspace-owner=VALUEworkspace
            Set the owner of the workspace created to commit. 
            This is useful when you need to create the workspace on behalf of someone else for example the author of the commit.         
                e.g. --workspace-owner "user"
                e.g. --workspace-owner "DOMAIN\user"
