## Examples

### Simple

To fetch all the changeset of the `default` remote:

    git tfs fetch

### Fetch from a branch

To fetch all the changesets of the `tfs/myBranch` remote:

    git tfs fetch -i myBranch

### Fetch from the current branch

To fetch all the changesets of the current remote:

    git tfs fetch -I

The current remote depend of the git commit that is currently checkouted. Git-tfs will look in the history
to find the appropriate remote to fetch.

### Fetch from all the remotes

To fetch all the changesets of all the initialized remotes

    git tfs fetch --all

Note: you could see all the tfs remotes already initialized using command `git tfs branch` and
all that exists on the tfs server using command `git tfs branch -r`

### Authentication

For the use of parameters `--username` and `--password`, see the [clone](clone.md) command.

### Map TFS users to git users

For the use of parameter `--authors`, see the [clone](clone.md) command.

### Fetching merge changesets

Merge changesets will be automatically fetched and created as a merge commit if the tfs branch merged has already been initialized in the git repository.
If the tfs branch merged has not be initialized, the merge changeset will be created as a normal commit (not a merged one) and this warning message will be created :

    warning: this changeset 34 is a merge changeset. But it can't have been managed accordingly because one of the parent changeset 33 is not present in the repository! If you want to do it, fetch the branch containing this changeset before retrying...

### Batch size of fetched changesets

The option `--batch-size` permit to specify the number of changesets fetched from tfs at the same time (default:100).
You could use this option to specify smaller batch size if git-tfs use too much memory because changesets are huge.
This option is not saved but you could add it to the git config file (key `git-tfs.batch-size`). See [config file doc](../config.md). 
Note: this option could also be specified during the `clone`.
