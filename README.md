## Introduction

[git-tfs](http://git-tfs.com/) is a two-way bridge between TFS (Team Foundation Server) and git, similar to git-svn.
It fetches TFS commits into a git repository, and lets you push your updates back to TFS.

[![git-tfs version](https://img.shields.io/github/release/git-tfs/git-tfs.svg?label=Actual%20Version:)](https://github.com/git-tfs/git-tfs/releases). See the [change history](https://github.com/git-tfs/git-tfs/releases) for details and download.

If you're having problems, check out the [troubleshooting](doc/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) page.
And read [how to report an issue](doc/reporting-issues.md), before doing so ;)

## We need your help

This project is no more **actively** maintained because we are no more users of TFS.
Thus being very useful, git-tfs is not exempt of not supported use cases.
If you encounter something missing or a problem, please contribute, we will be please to help you.

And remember:

>The fastest way to get an issue fixed is to submit a PR that fixes it.

>The slowest way to get it fixed is to hope someone else will fix it.

## Get git-tfs

To get a stable version:

* Download a binary. Find it on the [release page](https://github.com/git-tfs/git-tfs/releases),
* Using Chocolatey. If [Chocolatey](http://chocolatey.org/) is already installed on your computer, run `choco install gittfs` to install the [Chocolatey package](http://chocolatey.org/packages/gittfs)

To get a development version

* Build from source code. See §[Building](#building) for more informations...
* Download a package of the development version generated by the [last builds](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/pmiossec/git-tfs-v2qcm/build/artifacts) (in the artifacts section).

__Whatever the way you get git-tfs, you should have git-tfs.exe in your path (and git, too)__.

Add the git-tfs folder path to your PATH. You could also set it temporary (the time of your current terminal session) using :

    set PATH=%PATH%;%cd%\GitTfs\bin\Debug

## Use git-tfs

You need .NET 4 and either the 2010, 2012 or 2013 version of Team Explorer installed (or Visual Studio).

### Help

    #lists the available commands
    git tfs help

    #shows a summary of the usage of a given command
    git tfs help <command>

### Cloning

    # [optional] find a tfs repository path to clone :
    git tfs list-remote-branches http://tfs:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection

    # clone the whole repository (wait for a while...) :
    git tfs clone http://tfs:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection $/some_project

    # or, if you're impatient (and want to work from the last changeset) :
    git tfs quick-clone http://tfs:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection $/some_project

    # or, if you're impatient (and want a specific changeset) :
    git tfs quick-clone http://tfs:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection $/some_project -c=145

**Note:** Before cloning your repository, please have a look at the [clone command doc](doc/commands/clone.md) or [advanced use cases](#more-advanced-use-cases) to discover options that could help you!

### Working

    cd some_project
    git log # shows your TFS history, unless you did quick-clone
    tf history # error: no workspace ;)

    # [do work, do work, just using git], then...
    # gets latest from TFS to the branch tfs/default :
    git tfs fetch

### Checkin

    # report all the commits on TFS :
    git tfs rcheckin

    # or commit using the tfs checkin window
    git tfs checkintool

    # or commit with a message
    git tfs checkin -m "Did stuff"

    # or shelve your changes :
    git tfs shelve MY_AWESOME_CHANGES

git-tfs is designed to work outside of any existing TFS workspaces.

## Building

### Continuous Integration Status

[![AppVeyor build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/git-tfs/git-tfs)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/pmiossec/git-tfs-v2qcm)
( Great thanks to [<img src="https://www.appveyor.com/assets/img/favicons/favicon.ico" height="20"> AppVeyor](http://www.appveyor.com/)! )

### Prerequisites

* MSBuild (included in .NET 4)

And depending of the version of TFS you use :

* [Visual Studio 2013 SDK](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40758)
* [Visual Studio 2012 SDK](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30668)
* [Visual Studio 2010 SDK](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=21307C23-F0FF-4EF2-A0A4-DCA54DDB1E21&displaylang=en)

### Get the source code and build

    #get the source code
    git clone git://github.com/git-tfs/git-tfs.git
    cd git-tfs\src

    #building with Cake (in a powershell console). It will also run the unit tests ;)
    .\build.ps1

    #help on the different targets
    .\build.ps1 -Target "Help"

**Note:** if the build fails because you don't have all the `Visual Studio SDK`, just unload in Visual Studio all the projects you are not interested in to be able to build and use your own version.
You could also install, the Team Foundation Server Object Model for [Tfs 2010](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/a37e19fb-3052-4fc9-bef7-4a4682069a75) ([chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/tfs2010objectmodel)), [Tfs 2012](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/f30e5cc7-036e-449c-a541-d522299445aa) ([chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/tfs2012objectmodel)) and [Tfs 2013](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/3278bfa7-64a7-4a75-b0da-ec4ccb8d21b6) ([chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/tfs2013objectmodel)).

## Contributing
Contributions are always welcome. Thanks to all our [contributors](https://github.com/git-tfs/git-tfs/graphs/contributors)!

Please, read our short and simple [guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and our doc on how to use [paket](doc/paket.md), the package manager we use.

Especially, don't forget:

* to run the build task `.\build.ps1 -Target "FormatCode"` before committing (to keep code formatting consistent, and pull request easier to review)
* to set `core.autocrlf` to `true` (`git config core.autocrlf true`)
* to indent your code using 4 spaces (even if `.editorconfig` should take care of that).

## Migrations
If you're migrating a TFS server from 2008 or 2005 to 2010, you might want to [Specify Alternate TFS URLs](doc/specify-alternate-tfs-urls.md).

[v0.12]: http://sparethought.wordpress.com/2011/08/10/git-tfs-bridge-v0-12-released/

If you have questions or suggestions about how we could improve git-tfs you could go to [google group](http://groups.google.com/group/git-tfs-dev).

[Example](http://sparethought.wordpress.com/2011/07/18/how-to-establish-git-central-repository-for-working-against-tfs-with-git-tfs-bridge/) of setting up central git repository that tracks TFS automatically.
