## Introduction

[git-tfs](http://git-tfs.com/) is a two-way bridge between TFS (Team Foundation Server) and git, similar to git-svn.
It fetches TFS commits into a git repository, and lets you push your updates back to TFS.

The most recent version is __0.21.2__. See the [change history](https://github.com/git-tfs/git-tfs/releases) for details.

If you're having problems, check out the [troubleshooting](doc/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) page.
And read [how to report an issue](doc/reporting-issues.md), before doing so ;)

## Get git-tfs

Three different ways to get git-tfs:

* Download a binary. Find it on the [release page](https://github.com/git-tfs/git-tfs/releases),
* Using Chocolatey. If [Chocolatey](http://chocolatey.org/) is already installed on your computer, run `cinst gittfs` to install the [Chocolatey package](http://chocolatey.org/packages/gittfs)
* Build from source code. See §[Building](#building) for more informations...

__Whatever the way you get git-tfs, you should have git-tfs.exe in your path (and git, too)__.

Add the git-tfs folder path to your PATH. You could also set it temporary (the time of your current terminal session) using :

    set PATH=%PATH%;%cd%\GitTfs\bin\Debug

## Use git-tfs

You need .NET 4 and either the 2010, 2012 or 2013 version of Team Explorer installed (or Visual Studio).

### Help

    #lists the available commands
    git tfs help

    #shows a summary of the usage of a given command
    git tfs help <command>

### Cloning

    # [optional] find a tfs repository path to clone :
    git tfs list-remote-branches http://tfs:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection

    # clone the whole repository (wait for a while...) :
    git tfs clone http://tfs:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection $/some_project

    # or, if you're impatient (and want to work from the last changeset) :
    git tfs quick-clone http://tfs:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection $/some_project

    # or, if you're impatient (and want a specific changeset) :
    git tfs quick-clone http://tfs:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection $/some_project -c=145

### Working

    cd some_project
    git log # shows your TFS history, unless you did quick-clone
    tf history # error: no workspace ;)

    # [do work, do work, just using git], then...
    # gets latest from TFS to the branch tfs/default :
    git tfs fetch

### Checkin

    # report all the commits on TFS :
    git tfs rcheckin

    # or commit using the tfs checkin window
    git tfs checkintool 

    # or commit with a message
    git tfs checkin -m "Did stuff"

    # or shelve your changes :
    git tfs shelve MY_AWESOME_CHANGES

git-tfs is designed to work outside of any existing TFS workspaces.

## Building

### Prerequisites 

* MSBuild (included in .NET 4) 

And depending of the version of TFS you use :

* [Visual Studio 2013 SDK](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40758)
* [Visual Studio 2012 SDK](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30668)
* [Visual Studio 2010 SDK](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=21307C23-F0FF-4EF2-A0A4-DCA54DDB1E21&displaylang=en)

### Get the source code and build

    #get the source code (with submodules source code!)
    git clone --recursive git://github.com/git-tfs/git-tfs.git
    cd git-tfs

    #building with MSBuild (with the default configuration)
    msbuild GitTfs.sln

    #or building with MSBuild in debug
    msbuild GitTfs.sln /p:Configuration=debug

    #or building with MSBuild in release
    msbuild GitTfs.sln /p:Configuration=release

    #or with Rake (Ruby)
    rake build:debug

Note : if the build fails because it can't find libgit2sharp dependency, update submodules with `git submodule init` followed by `git submodule update`

## Contributing
Contributions are always welcome.

There are some simple [guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Migrations 
If you're migrating a TFS server from 2008 or 2005 to 2010, you might want to [Specify Alternate TFS URLs](doc/specify-alternate-tfs-urls.md).

[v0.12]: http://sparethought.wordpress.com/2011/08/10/git-tfs-bridge-v0-12-released/

If you have questions or suggestions about how we could improve git-tfs you could go to [google group](http://groups.google.com/group/git-tfs-dev).

[Example](http://sparethought.wordpress.com/2011/07/18/how-to-establish-git-central-repository-for-working-against-tfs-with-git-tfs-bridge/) of setting up central git repository that tracks TFS automatically.
