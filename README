git-tfs is a two-way bridge between TFS and git, similar to git-svn.

Use it like this:


git tfs clone http://tfs:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection $/some_project
(wait for git-tfs to pull your history)
-or-
git tfs quick-clone http://tfs:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection $/some_project

(cd some_project and hack away, using only git, until you need to share with TFS...)

git tfs shelve A_SHELVESET_NAME
-or-
git tfs checkin -m "Did stuff"
-or-
git tfs checkintool


`git tfs help` for more info.


INSTALLING
----------

Download (https://github.com/spraints/git-tfs/downloads#uploaded_downloads)
or build.

Add the directory that contains git-tfs.exe to your path. 

I've been using this with msysgit 1.7.3.1 for a while.

You need .NET 4 and either the 2008 or 2010 version of Team Explorer installed.


BUILDING
--------

msbuild (included in .NET 4) should be able to build the entire solution.

You can also do `rake build:debug`.

If you contribute patches, please set core.autocrlf to true.
  git config core.autocrlf true
