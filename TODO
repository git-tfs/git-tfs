git-svn has these commands:
  create/pull:
    clone (init + fetch)
    init
    fetch
    rebase
  commit:
    dcommit
    set-tree (lower-level form of dcommit)
    commit-diff (pushes diff of git revs to svn, does not require init)
  history:
    blame
    find-rev
    info
    log
  svn features:
    create-ignore
    propget
    proplist
    show-externals
    show-ignore
  internals:
    migrate (upgrade from one version of git-svn to another)

The commands that are implemented are:
  init
  fetch
  clone (init+fetch)
  shelve
  
The commands I plan to implement, in approximate order of priority:
  checkin (dcommit?) - to rewrite commits, or not to rewrite them.
  unshelve

These commands are in git-svn, but I'm not convinced git-tfs needs them.
  rebase
  find-rev
  log
  commit-diff ?
  migrate ?

Known bugs:
  None right now.

Other potential enhancements:
  * Use noodle for dependencies.
  * Query history in chunks, either in a background thread or just with 100 changeset chunks, in order to speed up the initial output from a fetch.
  * Support for TFS branches.
  * Make tags for changesets off by default.
  * More interesting workspace mappings, e.g. "$/Project1 -> Source; $/Project2/Libs -> Libs".
