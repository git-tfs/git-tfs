            This effectively runs `add --interactive`, but bypasses the
            initial command menu and directly jumps to the `patch` subcommand.

            for the path is placed in the index with no content. This is

            When the repository to clone is on the local machine, instead of using hard links, automatically setup .git/objects/info/alternates to share the objects 
            with the source repository. The resulting repository starts out without any object of its own. 
                 
            NOTE: this is a possibly dangerous operation; do not use it unless you understand what it does. If you clone your repository using this option and then 
            delete branches (or use any other git command that makes any existing commit unreferenced) in the source repository, some objects may become 
            unreferenced (or dangling). These objects may be removed by normal git operations (such as git-commit) which automatically call git gc --auto. 
            (See git-gc(1).) If these objects are removed and were referenced by the cloned repository, then the cloned repository will become corrupt.

            if the original file of the copy was modified in the same
            changeset.  This flag makes the command

            When '--stdin' is specified, the command does not take
            &lt;tree-ish&gt; arguments from the command line.  Instead, it
            reads lines containing either two &lt;tree&gt;, one &lt;commit&gt;, or a
            list of &lt;commit&gt; from its standard input.  (Use a single space
            as separator.)

            When two trees are given, it compares the first tree with the second.
            When a single commit is given, it compares the commit with its

            parents of the first commit.

            "&lt;TREE_ID&gt; [-p &lt;PARENT_COMMIT_ID&gt;]..." and the log message on
            stdin.  The commit id is expected on stdout.

            As a special extension, the commit filter may emit multiple

            have all of them as parents.

            convenience functions, too.  For example, calling 'skip_commit "$@"'

            'git commit-tree "$@"' if you don't wish to keep commits with a single parent

            object (or to a tag object which points to a rewritten object).
            The original tag name is passed via standard input, and the new
            tag name is expected on standard output.
            +
            The original tags are not deleted, but can be overwritten;
            use "--tag-name-filter cat" to simply update the tags.  In this
            case, be very careful and make sure you have the old tags
            backed up in case the conversion has run afoul.
            +
            Nearly proper rewriting of tag objects is supported. If the tag has
            a message attached, a new tag object will be created with the same message,
            author, and timestamp. If the tag has a signature attached, the
            signature will be stripped. It is by definition impossible to preserve
            signatures. The reason this is "nearly" proper, is because ideally if
            the tag did not change (points to the same object, has the same name, etc.)
            it should retain any signature. That is not the case, signatures will always
            be removed, buyer beware. There is also no support for changing the
            author or timestamp (or the tag message for that matter). Tags which point
            to other tags will be rewritten to point to the underlying commit.

            commit they point to was rewritten.  However, you can limit the extent
            of this rewriting by using linkgit:rev-list[1] arguments, e.g., path
            limiters.  Refs pointing to such excluded commits would then normally

            It is possible for 'git-pack-objects' to build
            "thin" pack, which records objects in deltified form based on
            objects not included in the pack to reduce network traffic.
            Those objects are expected to be present on the receiving end
            and they must be included in the pack for that pack to be self
            contained and indexable. Without this option any attempt to
            index a thin pack will fail. This option only makes sense in
            conjunction with --stdin.

                Specify that the git repository is to be shared amongst several users. This allows users belonging to the same group to push into that repository. When specified, the config variable "core.sharedRepository" is set so that files and directories under $GIT_DIR are created with the requested permissions. When not specified, git will use permissions reported by umask(2).
                The option can have the following values, defaulting to group if no value is given:
                * umask (or false): Use permissions reported by umask(2). The default, when --shared is not specified.
                * group (or true): Make the repository group-writable, (and g+sx, since the git group may be not the primary group of all users). This is used to loosen the permissions of an otherwise safe umask(2) value. Note that the umask still applies to the other permission bits (e.g. if umask is 0022, using group will not remove read privileges from other (non-group) users). See 0xxx for how to exactly specify the repository permissions.
                * all (or world or everybody): Same as group, but make the repository readable by all users.
                * 0xxx: 0xxx is an octal number and each file will have mode 0xxx. 0xxx will override users' umask(2) value (and not only loosen permissions as group and all does). 0640 will create a repository which is group-readable, but not group-writable or accessible to others. 0660 will create a repo that is readable and writable to the current user and group, but inaccessible to others.
                By default, the configuration flag receive.denyNonFastForwards is enabled in shared repositories, so that you cannot force a non fast-forwarding push into it.

            Use the merge resolution program specified by &lt;tool&gt;.
            Valid merge tools are:
            kdiff3, tkdiff, meld, xxdiff, emerge, vimdiff, gvimdiff, ecmerge,
            diffuse, tortoisemerge, opendiff, p4merge and araxis.
            +
            If a merge resolution program is not specified, 'git-mergetool'
            will use the configuration variable `merge.tool`.  If the
            configuration variable `merge.tool` is not set, 'git-mergetool'
            will pick a suitable default.
            +
            You can explicitly provide a full path to the tool by setting the
            configuration variable `mergetool.&lt;tool&gt;.path`. For example, you
            can configure the absolute path to kdiff3 by setting
            `mergetool.kdiff3.path`. Otherwise, 'git-mergetool' assumes the
            tool is available in PATH.
            +
            Instead of running one of the known merge tool programs,
            'git-mergetool' can be customized to run an alternative program
            by specifying the command line to invoke in a configuration
            variable `mergetool.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd`.
            +
            When 'git-mergetool' is invoked with this tool (either through the
            `-t` or `--tool` option or the `merge.tool` configuration
            variable) the configured command line will be invoked with `$BASE`
            set to the name of a temporary file containing the common base for
            the merge, if available; `$LOCAL` set to the name of a temporary
            file containing the contents of the file on the current branch;
            `$REMOTE` set to the name of a temporary file containing the
            contents of the file to be merged, and `$MERGED` set to the name
            of the file to which the merge tool should write the result of the
            merge resolution.
            +
            If the custom merge tool correctly indicates the success of a
            merge resolution with its exit code, then the configuration
            variable `mergetool.&lt;tool&gt;.trustExitCode` can be set to `true`.
            Otherwise, 'git-mergetool' will prompt the user to indicate the
            success of the resolution after the custom tool has exited.

            stream, but older version of git does not understand the

            former format for better compatibility.  This option
            allows the command to use the latter format for
            compactness.  Depending on the average delta chain
            length, this option typically shrinks the resulting
            packfile by 3-5 per-cent.

            Especially useful when packing a repository that is used

            with '-d'.  This will clean up the objects that `git prune`

            Usually you cannot revert a merge because you do not know which
            side of the merge should be considered the mainline.  This
            option specifies the parent number (starting from 1) of
            the mainline and allows revert to reverse the change
            relative to the specified parent.
            +
            Reverting a merge commit declares that you will never want the tree changes
            brought in by the merge.  As a result, later merges will only bring in tree
            changes introduced by commits that are not ancestors of the previously
            reverted merge.  This may or may not be what you want.

            Usually the command automatically creates a commit with
            a commit log message stating which commit was
            reverted.  This flag applies the change necessary
            to revert the named commit to your working tree
            and the index, but does not make the commit.  In addition,
            when this option is used, your index does not have to match
            the HEAD commit.  The revert is done against the
            beginning state of your index.
            +
            This is useful when reverting more than one commits'
            effect to your index in a row.

            such as Commit, Tag or Tree the Blob API may be used to inspect the the uncompressed internal representation.
